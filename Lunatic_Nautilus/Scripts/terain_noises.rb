# Terrain Step Sound
# Version 1.2
# Author game_guy
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Intro:
# Create nice aesthetics with terrain noise. As you walk across grass or sand,
# let it play a beautiful noise to add to the atmosphere and realism of the
# game.
#
# Features:
# Specific Sound for Each Terrain
# Specific Sounds for Each Tileset
# Specify Volume and Pitch
# Specify an array of sounds for each terrain, allowing random sounds for each step
#
# Instructions:
# Setup the config below, its pretty self explanatory, more instructions
# with config.
#
# You can now change the sound rate in game using a script call.
# $game_map.rate = X
# X = sound rate (the lower the value, the more frequent the sounds)
#
# Credits:
# game_guy ~ For creating it
# Tuggernuts ~ For requesting it a long time ago
# Sase ~ For also requeseting it

  # Enter in sounds for each terrain tag
  # Goes from 0-8. Set as nil to disable that terrain or delete the line.
  # Each terrain must now be an array. This allows you to define multiple
  # sound effects for each terrain.

  #===========================================================================
  # If you would like to specifiy a volume and pitch, simply set the
  # terrain as an array.
  # Terrains[7] = [["sound", volume, pitch]]
  # Just set it as a string if you would like the volume to be at 100 and
  # pitch at 0.
  # This also applies for tilesets below.
  # You can also define multiple sound effects with pitch and volume.
  #===========================================================================

  #===========================================================================
  # With tilesets, you can set specific sounds for each tileset so you don't
  # have the same sounds. Add a new line and put
  # Tilesets[tileset id] = []
  # Then for each terrain put
  # Tilesets[tileset id][terrain id] = ["sound file", "sound file2", etc...]
  # If a sound doesn't exist for a tileset, it will play a default sound,
  # if a default doesn't exist, no sound at all.
  #===========================================================================
  #Tilesets[2] = []
  #Tilesets[2][0] = ["Sound"]
