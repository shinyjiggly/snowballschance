# ** Multiple Message Windows Ex 1.6d                                 2016-08-21

  ForeverZer0's Notes
  
- Credit for the original script is 100% Wachunga. Original map and events
  are also Wachunga's original.
- Edits have been made by ForeverZer0 to eliminate the SDK requirement
  and improve coding and performance
- I have added a compatibility switch for Blizzard's simple shaded text if you
  are you using that, because it doesn't look right with message text. The 
  switch will disable it whenever a message is showing, but otherwise will
  shade everything else.
- This script must be placed below Blizzard's Tons-of-Add-ons if you are
  using it. If you don't you will get an error. It has something to do with
  the Lagless HUD script. Some bug I couldn't isolate... If you find it, let
  me know, else just keep it under Tons.

  LiTTleDRAgo's Notes
  
- This script is edited and remodeled a bit by me to make it compatible with 
  Blizz ABS (and pst... H Mode 7)
- Although this version is de-SDK-ed by F0, This version should be 80% 
  compatible with SDK 
- Some features were added to enchanche this script functionality

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

  This custom message system adds numerous features on top of the default
  message system, the most notable being the ability to have multiple message
  windows open at once. The included features are mostly themed around turning
  messages into speech (and thought) balloons, but default-style messages are
  of course still possible.

  The original version of the script uses the SDK, seems to be lost

  Full list of options:

  (Note that all are case *insensitive*.)
  
  =============================================================================
   Local (specified in message itself and resets at message end)
  =============================================================================
  - \L = letter-by-letter mode toggle
  - \S[n] = set speed at which text appears in letter-by-letter mode
  - \D[n] = set delay (in frames) before next text appears
  - \P[n] = position message over event with id n
            * use n=0 for player
            * in battle, use n=a,b,c,d for actors (e.g. \P[a] for first actor)
              and n=1,...,n for enemies (e.g. \P[1] for first enemy)
              where order is actually the reverse of troop order (in database)
  - \P = position message over current event (default for floating messages)
  - \^ = message appears directly over its event
  - \v = message appears directly below its event
  - \< = message appears directly to the left of its event
  - \> = message appears directly to the right of its event
  - \B = bold text
  - \I = italic text
  - \C[#xxxxxx] = change to color specified by hexadecimal (eg. ffffff = white)
  - \C = change color back to default
  - \! = message autoclose
  - \? = wait for user input before continuing
  - \+ = make message appear at same time as preceding one
         * note: must be at the start of message to work
  - \# = insert the last message with line text the preceding one       
  - \@ = thought balloon
  - \N[En] = display name of enemy with id n (note the "E")
  - \N[Pn] = display name of event with id n (note the "P")
  - \N[In] = display name of item with id n (note the "I")
  - \N[Wn] = display name of weapon with id n (note the "W")
  - \N[An] = display name of armor with id n (note the "A")
  - \N[Sn] = display name of skill with id n (note the "S")
  - \I[In] = display icon of item with id n (note the "I")
  - \I[Wn] = display icon of weapon with id n (note the "W")
  - \I[An] = display icon of armor with id n (note the "A")
  - \I[Sn] = display icon of skill with id n (note the "S")
  - \I&N[In] = display icon and name of item with id n (note the "I")
  - \I&N[Wn] = display icon and name of weapon with id n (note the "W")
  - \I&N[An] = display icon and name of armor with id n (note the "A")
  - \I&N[Sn] = display icon and name of skill with id n (note the "S")
  - \MAP = display the name of the current map

  These are, of course, in addition to the default options:
  - \V[n] = display value of variable n
  - \N[n] = display name of actor with id n
  - \C[n] = change color to n
  - \G = display gold window
  - \\ = show the '\' character
  
  * Foot Forward Notes * - Sprite Sheets only have 16 total Frames of Animation
    and of which, 4 are duplicates.  Foot Forward Options allow access to
    ALL of the frames of animation available in Default Sprite Sheets.
    
  - \F+  = character puts their Foot Forward
  - \F*  = character puts their Other Foot Forward
  - \F-  = character resets their Foot Forward
  
  *NOTE* - Foot Forward Animation will RESET if the event is moved off screen.
         - Change @auto_ff_reset if this feature causes you trouble with
           character animations.
    
    It also ONLY works with the following conditions
    - Direction Fix is OFF
    - Move Animation is ON
    - Stop Animation is OFF (technically thats Step, they typo'd)
    - @auto_ff_reset is TRUE
    - * These settings are the DEFAULT when a New Event is created

   Global (specified below or by Call Script and persist until changed)

  Zer0 Note:

  - message.sound_pitch = n
    * Text Sound Pitch (100 is default)
  - message.sound_pitch_range = n
    * How Much to vary the Pitch (10 = pitch of 90 to 110 with base 100)
  - message.sound_frequency = n
    * Plays a sound this many letters  
  - message.sound_vary_pitch = true / false / 'random'     
    *  Whether to Vary the Pitch or not, or totally randomize
    ** If random, use quotes and lower case: 'random'    

  Note that the default thought and shout balloon windowskins don't
  stretch to four lines very well (unfortunately).
