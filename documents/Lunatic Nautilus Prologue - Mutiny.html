    <p class="c4"><span class="c5">THE OPENING BATTLE</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The game begins immediately with a battle. Dolph, Jeremiah, Cleaver, and seven nameless, generic pirates fight against 5 Natsiya Soldiers on a ship deck. This battle is basically impossible to lose unless you try, and serves primarily as an action-packed opening and to introduce the 10-person battle system.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6 c5">AFTER THE FIGHT</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Upon victory, the scene cuts to a field view of the ship, with the pirates standing before the defeated soldiers.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Right, men! Time for payday! Take everything that isn&#39;t nailed down, and then some!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pirates: Aye aye!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The seven generic pirates disappear below deck, and Cleaver turns to Dolph.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: I gotta hand it to ye&hellip; These Imperial ships turn quite a profit.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Reconsidering your position, are you?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Hardly! Yer a fool, Dolph. Merchant ships are far more common, and they put up less of a fight. If ye weren&#39;t so damn soft&hellip;!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Jeremiah raises his fists.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jeremiah: Watch your tongue, ribbit! The Captain is your Captain as well!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Calm down, Jeremiah. Regardless of your thoughts on our new targets, Cleaver, surely even you have to admit&hellip; this feels like old times. The Twin Terrors, remember?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Ha&hellip; Maybe so. Maybe so.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">A pirate comes up from below deck.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pirate: Cap&rsquo;n! Come down, quick!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Eh? What is it?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The pirate leads Dolph below deck. Jeremiah and Cleaver follow.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6 c5">BELOW THE WARSHIP DECK</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">There, the other pirates stand around a glass case with a glowing deep blue sphere inside. No other objects can be seen.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: What?! Is this all they had?!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pirate: It seems so. We&#39;ve cleared out their rations and supplies - around a week&rsquo;s worth - and there was a few thousand gold, but&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Stand aside.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The others do so, allowing Dolph to approach the case.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Hm&hellip; If the Empire devoted an entire ship to this thing, it must be worth something.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dolph draws his axe and swings it horizontally, shattering the glass case. He picks up the strange orb and places it in his coat pocket.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Right! We&rsquo;ll examine it more closely when we get back to the cove. Now - who&rsquo;s ready for some grog?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The pirates, save Cleaver, cheer, and the crew exits the hold. Cleaver is the last to leave, and lingers to cast one more glance at the hold&hellip; The LUNATIC NAUTILUS title card appears, followed by PROLOGUE: MUTINY. Fade to black.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6 c5">CONTROLLING CLEAVER</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Fade into the pirate ship&rsquo;s deck, night. All is quiet, until Cleaver enters from below deck.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Can&#39;t sleep&hellip; Need to breathe in the air o&rsquo; the sea.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The player gains control of Cleaver. If they try to go back below deck&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Not yet&hellip; I&#39;ll stay out here a bit longer.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">If they check the steering wheel&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: One day, I&#39;ll be the one steering.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">If they climb to the crow&rsquo;s nest, Cleaver spots something.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Eh? Is that&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Cut to a small dinghy crossing the sea. Cut back.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Heh&hellip; What Dolph don&#39;t know won&#39;t hurt &#39;im.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Cut to the dinghy, now closer. A mysterious man stands at the fore, peering out across the sea.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">???: ...Damn, it&#39;s coming closer.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Cut to the pirate ship, now beside the dinghy with its plank ready for boarding. Cleaver boards the dinghy, sword drawn. The mystery man draws a rapier.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">???: Just one of you?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: I&#39;ll be plenty!</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6 c5">THE MYSTERY MAN</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">A battle with the mystery man ensues, with the player controlling Cleaver. Though it&#39;s harder than the intro battle due to being one-on-one, Cleaver&rsquo;s high stats and Umbral Magic make it fairly easy. The mystery man fights with a variety of magic, as well as pistol and rapier attacks. The battle does not end with a victory screen, but with Dolph interrupting - this also occurs if Cleaver drops to critical HP, but you&#39;ll miss out on an item later.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: CLEAVER! That&#39;s ENOUGH!</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6 c5">DOLPH&rsquo;S INTERRUPTION</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The scene cuts back to the field, with Cleaver and the mystery man standing at a distance, both with weapons drawn. The camera pans to the pirate ship, where Dolph, Jeremiah, and the other 7 pirates stand.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Stand down. You know this isn&#39;t how we do things now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Dolph, you damn coward! Yer just gonna let this man an&rsquo; his booty go? Because, what, yer scared o&rsquo; Hell?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: No, you idiot!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Then why?!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Because if we only raid Imperial ships, we become folk heroes! And then the merchants and adventurers just GIVE us their booty!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: That&#39;s a lie! And yer--</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jeremiah: Shut up, ribbit! Don&#39;t talk back to the Captain!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: You get back on this ship, and I won&#39;t have you walk the plank for this. How&#39;s that sound?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Everyone pauses for a moment. Finally, Cleaver sighs and sheathes his sword.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Fine. But just ye wait, Dolph&hellip; One day, ye&#39;ll slip up, and the Empire will have ye hung fer it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Dolph turns away.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Men! Throw him in the brig!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pirates: Aye aye!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">A pair of pirates grab Cleaver from either side and pull him back onto the ship.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">???: Will that be all, then?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: ...Never speak of this to anyone. You may go.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Dolph walks back below deck, the other pirates following. </span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6 c5">THE BRIG</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Fade to the brig, with Cleaver behind bars and Dolph standing outside.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: You dirty dog&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Enough with the insults, Cleaver. Why would you do that? Attack that ship, alone, without permission?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Because there was no reason not to! I nearly had that ponce beaten, and if ye had fought with me and not against me it would have been effortless to kill him!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: And for what? The few supplies of a wandering adventurer?! Don&#39;t try to ascribe some goal to your bloodthirstiness!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: And don&#39;t try to ascribe one to your phony virtue!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The two stare each other down for a moment.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: ...What happened to you, Cleaver? To us? We used to fight side by side, the Twin Terrors!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: And then you decided to grow a conscience, and focus on the Empire.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Dolph shakes his head.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Maybe you&#39;re right&hellip; But so what if it is out of altruism? Is it really so bad, that we focus our efforts on&hellip; doing some good in the world? And even without that, our loot has been better than ever--</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Oh, like that little trinket from that last ship?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Dolph pulls the orb from his coat.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: I&#39;m telling you&hellip; if the Natsiyans had that many men defending this thing, it must be worth something. A magical artifact of some sort, or a crown jewel.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Bah&hellip; It&#39;s not about the loot anyway. It&#39;s about our reputation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Are you really so attached to that idea? Of being the terror of the seas?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: &hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Dolph sighs, then leaves the brig.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: ...It&#39;s the next best thing to being one of the Twin Terrors.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Fade out. </span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6 c5">THE COVE</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Fade back into the ship docking inside a cove, with yet more generic pirates waiting. Dolph leads his men out, and they lead Cleaver, his arms tied behind his back. One of the pirates in the cove speaks up.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pirate: Captain, what happened to Cleaver?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: He acted against orders - raided a small dinghy piloted [note: look up proper word for this] by some no-name adventurer. We&rsquo;ll untie him at the crack of dawn tomorrow. Tonight - we drink!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The pirates cheer, and the pirates, save Cleaver, head deeper into the cove. Cleaver looks down as the scene fades out. </span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6 c5">[MAYBE INSERT SOME EXPLORATION AND INTERACTION IN THE COVE HERE?] </span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6 c5">WE&rsquo;RE RAIDING MOLNYA</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Fade into the same dock, the next day - Cleaver now asleep. Dolph enters.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Oy!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3">Cleaver doesn&#39;t respond, so Dolph approaches and prods him. Cleaver leaps up in comical surprise.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Arr, Imperial bastard! I&#39;ll gut ye like a&hellip;!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Cleaver pauses and looks over at Dolph.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Ah, it&#39;s just you.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: That it is. We&#39;ve decided - we&#39;re raiding Molnya.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Molnya?! The Imperial port town?!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: I thought you wanted more action?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: ...Aye, I suppose so. Very well, then - I won&#39;t be much good with my arms bound. Care to deal with that?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Dolph unties Cleaver.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Right, then. I&#39;ll gather the men, and then we shall set sail!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Fade out. </span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6 c5">CALM BEFORE THE SCORN (please god come up with something better than this)</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Fade into the ship, on the high seas. Dolph and Cleaver stand together at the bow, with the other pirates, including Jeremiah, busily operating the ship.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: We&#39;re nearly there. Molnya awaits&hellip; just over the horizon.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Hmph. Let&#39;s hope things work out.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">A voice comes from the crow&#39;s nest.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pirate: Land ho! It&#39;s in our sights!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Hm&hellip; We&#39;d best get prepared. Cleaver, you take the men below deck and get them equipped. I&#39;ll make sure we get to our destination.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: ...Aye aye. Men! Let&#39;s go!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Cleaver and the other pirates disappear below deck. Jeremiah remains behind, however, along with Dolph.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: ...Shouldn&#39;t you be getting equipped?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jeremiah: I use my bare hands, ribbit. Besides, I would never leave you alone up here.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: ...Why are you so attached to me, anyway?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jeremiah: I owe you a life debt. You saved my life, ribbit, and so it is my duty to defend yours.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Heh&hellip; Guess you frog folks take that sort of thing seriously. Hell, you&#39;ve hardly left my side since I got you off that slaver ship.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jeremiah: Well&hellip; that part isn&#39;t the life debt, ribbit.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Eh? What&#39;s that supposed to mean?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jeremiah: There is a kindness in you, ribbit. You may not show it&hellip; but yours is a heart I am glad to give myself to.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Ah, you flatter me. In any case&hellip; I&#39;m glad to have you around, Jeremiah.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jeremiah: I&#39;m glad you feel that about me, ribbit.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Cleaver, and the other pirates, emerge from below deck.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Everything&#39;s in order, Captain.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Thank you, Cleaver. Just in time, too.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The camera pans to the front of the ship, where Molnya comes into view. People standing in the area jump in surprise and run off.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: So much for the element of surprise, eh?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Cleaver draws his sword and grins.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: We won&#39;t&#8203; need it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The ship finally reaches a point where the town is alongside it, and Cleaver leaps out, along with two pirates.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Right. Jeremiah, you three, you&#39;re with me!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Dolph leaps out of the ship, Jeremiah and three generic pirates following. </span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6 c5">THE RAID</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">This leads to a fairly short &ldquo;dungeon&rdquo; which is largely a series of setpieces. The first occurs only a short while down the street, when Dolph ducks around a corner to see Natsiyan soldiers marching ahead.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Damn&hellip; Don&#39;t think we can stick to the main roads.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jeremiah: How about there, ribbit?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Jeremiah points to a nearby alleyway.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Perfect.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The party enters the alleyway, and soon stumbles upon two soldiers.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soldier A: You know, I hear there&#39;s some new gang springing up in [ancient ruined empire]</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soldier B: Bah&hellip; that place is anarchy. I don&#39;t see why we should--</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Soldier B notices the pirates.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soldier B: Hey! Aren&#39;t you those pirates?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Dolph grins and draws his axe, and&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6 c5">FIGHTING THEM HEAD-ON</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">T</span><span class="c3 c2">he battle begins. It&#39;s quite easy. </span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6 c5">PASSAGE</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">From here on groups of one to three soldiers appear as encounters. Later, the party is intercepted by seven Natsiyan soldiers.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soldier: Stop right there, pirate scum!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Damn&hellip;! Outnumbered!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">???: Allow me to help.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">A chunk of ice drops into one of the soldiers, killing him. The wanderer Cleaver attacked before enters from behind the party.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: You&hellip;?! What are you doing here, wanderer?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">???: You saved me. I&#39;m merely repaying the kindness. Besides, an enemy of the Empire is a friend of mine.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The wanderer gets into a battle stance, the five pirates following.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">???: Oh&hellip; And call me Daraway.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6 c5">DARAWAY SHOWS OFF</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">A battle ensues. Though it&#39;s technically six on six, the soldiers are underpowered compared to the party and will go down easily, allowing the player plenty of experimentation with Daraway&rsquo;s abilities. </span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6 c5">MUTINY</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Afterwards, Daraway turns to the party.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Daraway: I saw your rude friend on the way here. He&#39;s got quite a few pirates with him&hellip; and I heard them talk about going after Dolph. That&#39;s you, correct?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: What?! But that&#39;s&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Mutiny.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The camera pans to show Cleaver, with a small army of pirates at his back.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Cleaver! What is the meaning of this?!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Yer a damn coward, Dolph. An&rsquo; yer men have had enough.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The three pirates accompanying the party walk to Cleaver&rsquo;s side.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: This is preposterous! When did you even--!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Oh, I&#39;ve discussed it here and there&hellip; when you were out of earshot. But it was below deck, before we landed, when I gave them the final command.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Dolph draws his axe.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: You bastards! You&#39;ll regret standing against--!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Daraway gestures, and a wall of of earth bursts out of the ground between the two groups.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Daraway!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Daraway: Sorry, but with the number of men he&#39;s got I can&#39;t imagine that would have gone well. Let&#39;s get out of here, shall we?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: ...Right. I assume you have a ship?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Daraway: Of course. Come!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Daraway leads the party off, and&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6 c5">THE DUNGEON CONTINUES.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">From here on, small groups of 2-3 pirates will appear in addition to the soldiers, though the two enemy types never appear at the same time. Eventually, Cleaver and his army finally catch up to the party in a chokepoint between the side of a building and the sea.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: No more running, friend!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Dolph draws his axe.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Jeremiah! Daraway! Go bring the ship around! I&#39;ll handle these dogs.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jeremiah: Captain! Are you sure, ribbit?!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Daraway: This is between them. Come.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Daraway and Jeremiah escape.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: Enough games, Cleaver! You and me!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Cleaver laughs.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: And why would I do that, when all these men swear allegiance to me?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: You wouldn&#39;t&hellip;!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Go get &#39;im!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The pirates advance, and&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6 c5">BATTLE AGAINST CLEAVER</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">A</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;battle ensues. Cleaver is technically present, but he is behind 4 pirates, and cannot be attacked until all of them are defeated. Making this more difficult is the fact that, every 2 turns, if at least one of the pirates has been defeated, an additional pirate will join the fray. This never stops happening, and Cleaver is attacking with dark magic all the while. Whatever the player tries, it will be all they can do to stay alive in this 5-on-1 battle. Thankfully, after around 20 turns&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jeremiah: Captain!</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c6 c5">RESCUE</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Cut back to the field, where Daraway&rsquo;s ship has arrived.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dolph: About damn time you showed up!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Jeremiah leaps down and grabs Dolph before jumping back onboard with him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Daraway: Alright! Let&#39;s move!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The ship begins to sail away, and Cleaver rushes to the edge of the town&rsquo;s platform.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleaver: Ye&rsquo;d best run, yellowbelly! If ye ever show her face here again, I&#39;ll cut it off!</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Panning back to the ship, Dolph seems regretful as he and his party speed away and the screen fades out. The chapter ends.</span></p>
