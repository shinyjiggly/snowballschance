This is the script entry that marks below what you HAVE to put the Animated
Battlers script.

This, also, is an annotation saying you that, in case that you want to use
a new version of the script, you CAN. The script is SUPPOSED to be made in 
that way that it permits you to.

If you do change the version, and you get a bug, I will thank you if you point 
me about it, since it's a thing that probably needs further testing.

Thanks.
