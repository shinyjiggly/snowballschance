Configuration has been broken down into four main config sections.
- RowStuff: Effects on status for positions. Used in conjunction with formations.
- RSS Config: Everything related to the battle system is in here.
- AnimatedBattlers's Configuration script: All battler animation configuration is here.
- Animated Battler Formations: Visual aspect of formations.

Please take a deep look at those scripts. This battle system is not easy to 
configure, but as you get those stuff done, you'll be free from it C:.

It's possible to just use vanilla configuration. But it makes things less custom.
