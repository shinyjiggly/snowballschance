These addons are the ones that I can't give proper feedback. Any of the ones 
above this script entry, I can. Any of below, I can't.

It's a matter of not knowing exactly how those work (and I'm "busy" for giving
them a proper reading C:).

Anyway, I'm only giving support for the above ones because some of them are 
either OLD, or their autors are friends of mine :). OR the scripts are just like,
IMPORTANT and are like part of the core of this system.

Good luck with your game, and hope this all helps you with it,
