# Known issues
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ballonskins need prior treatment before the game can use it to draw balloons. For this reason, small latencies may be experienced upon loading each Balloonskin for the first time. To avoid this, it is possible to precompile all Ballonskins at once when the game starts, resulting in a normal latency before loading the title scene (disabled by default).
