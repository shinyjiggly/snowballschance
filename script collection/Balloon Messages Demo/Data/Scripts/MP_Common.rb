Moonpearl's Common Stuff
Author: Moonpearl
Version: 1.00
This script contains custom functions I use quite often, so instead of making copies for each script I write, I put them all here. Everything is needed to make this or that script of mine work - and is pretty useful for scripters anyway. If you're experiencing compatibility problems, or are not sure about a particular feature, please refer to its description.

If you use any of those as a basis for your own script, consider it a giveaway. Express credit is not required, but is appreciated. Otherwise, a warm-hearted thank you will do.

Load preferably right after MP Scene_Base, before any other custom scripts.

# NOTES - 
# - Tweaks are completely safe since they do not modify any existing code
# - Classes are safe too because they are new to Ruby and RGSS code
# - Mods are relatively safe but might possibly cause issues - refer to the
#     entry's description for more information.
