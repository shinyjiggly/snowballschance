Moonpearl's Scene_Base
Author: Moonpearl
Version: 1.00
This bundle does absolutely nothing to your game. It simply changes the structure of some elements to make them easier to work with in a scriptwise perspective. It should not cause any compatibility issues since it merely reorganizes code rather than modify it. If you ever experience compatibility issues using this along with an outsider custom script, you are allowed to tell its author he's been messing up. :p

Load preferably right after RPG Maker Base Engine, before any other custom scripts.
